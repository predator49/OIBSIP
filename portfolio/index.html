  <h1> Introduction</h1>
  <p>Greetings,

Allow me to introduce myself – I am Om Yadav, a 20-year-old individual with a passion for both technology and sports. Currently in my third year pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering at DIT University in Dehradun, I have embarked on a journey to expand my horizons and delve into the fascinating world of computer science.</p>

<p>In addition to my academic pursuits, I have a remarkable accomplishment under my belt – I have played professional cricket, a testament to my dedication and hard work in the field of sports. This experience has not only honed my teamwork and discipline but has also added a unique dimension to my character.</p>

<p>
My journey is a blend of academic excellence, sporting achievements, and a relentless wanderlust. With a fervent passion for both technology and exploration, I am determined to make the most of every opportunity that life presents.</p>
